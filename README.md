# WordPress Core Functionalities Plugin

[![WordPress Core Functionalities Plugin v1.0.2.1 badge][changelog-badge]][changelog] [![Version v1.0.2.1 Badge][version-badge]][changelog] [![Last Commit Badge][last-commit-badge]][commits]

A plugin to keep the functionalities unrelated to theme-develop. Thought-out for developers.

## Description

This plugin holds functionalities to improve your WordPress instalation.<br>
It creates two new Custom Post Types to manage your **Portfolio posts** and **Team members** separated from native blog posts and pages.<br>
It also renames the WordPress dashboard **Posts** in to **Blog posts**.<br>
This plugin was created to use mainly in small client's sites (and my own), based on the way I work and my personal needs as a WordPress developer.

## Requirements

-   WordPress 5.3 , tested up to 6.2.2

## Installation

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from the Plugins page.
